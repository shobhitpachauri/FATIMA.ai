The health and safety of all Comets is our priority. We encourage all faculty, staff, and students to stay home if you have symptoms of contagious illness, and to seek medical attention if your symptoms are severe. Currently, standard UTD absence policies and procedures are in effect and the supplemental tracking and reporting of contagious illness incidence in our UTD campus community (COVID-19, flu, or other illnesses) is not required.

    "https://www.utdallas.edu/visitors/visitor-parking/": "THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT\u00a0DALLAS Facilities & Economic\u00a0Development Auxiliary Services Menu \u00a0|\u00a0 Search Section 51.207 of the Texas Education Code allows the\n University of Texas at Dallas to restrict parking on our campus to vehicles with\n a parking permit or pass from the University, and to issue citations to vehicles that do not have a current parking\n permit or pass. It also requires UT Dallas to enforce Texas vehicle inspection\u00a0laws. \u00a0 Parking permits are available to all current UT Dallas visitors, students, faculty, and staff.\n You can buy a permit in-person from the Parking Office or you can buy your permit online. Please note,\n the Parking Office accepts credit and debit cards, but not cash or\u00a0checks. Purchasing a permit allows you to park according to the privileges of the permit\n you purchased. However, purchasing a permit does not guarantee parking in a specific\n space, lot, or\u00a0garage. Commuter students can purchase \nOrange, \nEvening Orange, \nGold, or \nGreen parking permits. Commuter students cannot purchase permits for on campus housing parking lots. If a student moves into on campus housing later in the semester, they may contact our office to exchange their current commuter parking permit for their respective housing parking permit. The current permit value will be assigned to their permit\u00a0exchange. Accessible parking permits are also available for qualified commuter students (see\u00a0below). Students who live on campus and will be parking on campus are required to purchase their respective housing permit, either a \nUniversity Commons Residence Halls parking permit, or a \nUniversity Village Apartments & \nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments parking permit. Students that live on campus are also allowed to purchase a \u201ccombo\u201d Housing and commuter \nOrange or \nGold permit so they may park in commuter spaces on campus during the day. \nAccessible parking permits are also for qualified students living on campus (see\u00a0below). Students that live on campus can only park overnight in their respective residential lots. Parking overnight in commuter parking spaces or parking garages is strictly prohibited, even if the student owns a combo\u00a0permit. Students that live on campus are only allowed to purchase one parking permit and may only park one vehicle on campus at any given\u00a0time. Only students living on campus may purchase a \nUniversity Commons Residence Halls parking permit, or a \nUniversity Village Apartments & \nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments parking permit. For students that move out of on-campus housing, our office can exchange their permit to a comparable commuter parking permit at no additional\u00a0cost. Faculty and Staff can purchase \nPurple, \nOrange, \nEvening Orange, \nGold, or \nGreen parking permits. \nAccessible parking permits are also available for qualified employees (see\u00a0below). Please be advised that employees with past due parking citations cannot purchase a parking permit until their account balance is paid. In addition to purchasing via credit/debit card, qualified employees may be eligible to purchase their parking permit via payroll deduction. Those who have a student classification (e.g., \nRA [Resident Advisor] s, \nTA [Teaching Assistant] s) and temporary employees are not eligible for payroll\u00a0deduction. All deductions are pretax and deducted over a period of one to nine months, depending on the date of\u00a0sale. There is no deadline to sign up for payroll deduction, however, to be eligible to be on the nine-month deduction plan, employees need to apply no later than September\u00a010. For those enrolling by September\u00a010, deductions will begin on the October\u00a01\u00a0paycheck. Those that purchase their permit via payroll deduction later in the fiscal year will have the total number of deductions reduced to meet the annual payment date. Please note that the monthly deduction amount will increase to meet the annual payment date, meaning the later an employee applies for payroll deduction, the fewer deductions they may have, but they may in turn have a higher monthly amount\u00a0deducted. A permit can be purchased as soon as a customer has access to their Parking Account. Commuter students, faculty, and staff may park in \nGreen parking without a permit from the first day of class until Census Day. This grace period only applies to the Fall and Spring\n semesters. The Summer semester requires a permit at all times. On-campus residents may\n park in their respective housing lot without a permit from the scheduled University Housing move-in dates until Census Day. With the exception of the Grace period for \nGreen and housing areas, all other parking areas\n will be enforced throughout the\u00a0year. You must purchase a parking permit before the Spring or Fall Census Day to avoid citations. You can register your vehicles to your Virtual Permit through the online Parking Portal.\n To register a vehicle online, log in to your MyParking account and select the vehicles tab. You will then\n be able to add a vehicle by entering the license plate and other vehicle details.\n Students may register two (2) vehicles to their virtual permit and employees\n may register five (5) vehicles to their virtual permit; however, only\n one vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. Parking more than one vehicle\n on campus at one time may lead to citations. The current fine amount for parking multiple vehicles on campus is $100, per\u00a0vehicle. A permit must be purchased and linked to your vehicle before parking on campus\n to avoid citations. You may add vehicles to your permit at anytime online via the MyParking portal, but you must contact our office at park@utdallas.edu to remove vehicles. Vehicles may only be registered to one customer. If your\n vehicle is already in the system due to citations or because it has been registered to another customer, you will not be able to add the vehicle to your account. You must contact our office at park@utdallas.edu to have the license plate\n verified for registration. Please note vehicles can be requested to be updated up\n to three times per semester. Exchanging vehicles on your permit more frequently may\n be\u00a0denied. It is essential that all vehicle information is kept up-to-date to avoid receiving\n a citation. Please log into your parking account to update your information immediately\n after any change to your license plate or vehicle. In the event that you drive a\n different vehicle to campus, you will also need to ensure that it is currently\n registered to your permit before parking on\u00a0campus. Parking permits may not be purchased, transferred or obtained from any source or party\n other than the UT Dallas Parking and Transportation Office. Displaying or registering\n a parking permit that belongs to another customer is strictly prohibited and may lead\n to vehicle immobilization and additional fees and\u00a0penalties. Students, faculty, or staff from other UT\u00a0System institutions may submit their University parking permit receipt to the Parking & Transportation Office via email to be issued a comparable reciprocal UTD permit. The email request must be sent from your UT institution email address, and the receipt must display your name, date of purchase, and the amount paid for your\u00a0permit. You can cancel, upgrade, downgrade or exchange your permit by completing a permit return form. Please completely fill out your information in all blanks and ensure you provide a detailed note response for returning your\u00a0permit. Please note that you will need your current permit number to complete this form. You can find your permit number by logging into your MyParking account and selecting the \u201cPERMITS\u201d\u00a0tab. Upgrades: Please note that requests to upgrade will require an additional out-of-pocket payment of the difference in current price between your current and upgraded\u00a0permit. Exchanges: For exchanges of the same value, no payment will be required, and no refund will be issued. Students who move between University Village Apartments, Canyon Creek Heights Apartments or University Commons Residence Halls must request to exchange their current parking permit for the permit appropriate for their new residence; this exchange is free of charge. Students transitioning between commuter and on-campus resident must also request to exchange their\u00a0permit. Downgrades: You may be eligible for a prorated refund of the difference in current price between your current and downgraded permit when downgrading your parking permit. Students may only downgrade their permit once per\u00a0semester. Cancellations: You may be eligible for a refund of your current permit value if you request to cancel your parking permit either within 10 days of your initial purchase, or if you are canceling your permit prior to the Spring Census Day of the current academic year. If you are withdrawing from the University or decide you no longer need your permit, you may return the permit within 10 days from the date of purchase for a full refund. If you are a student who is graduating or leaving the University at the end of the Fall semester and you paid the full year permit price, you may request to cancel (deactivate) your parking permit on or before the Spring Census Day of the current academic year for a prorated refund. Any cancellation requests for those that purchased a full year permit that are submitted after 10 days, but before Spring Census Day of the current academic year will receive a refund only for the Spring permit value. Spring permits are only eligible for a refund if returned within 10 days of purchase. Any cancellation requests submitted after the Spring Census Day of the current academic year will be denied and no refund will be issued. Students may only request a refund of their permit once per academic\u00a0year. You will receive a confirmation email after you have submitted your permit return form. Please allow seven business days for your permit return to be completed. Do not submit a permit return form until you no longer need your parking permit as it will be processed shortly after submission. Your current parking permit is valid until your permit return has been processed. You will receive email confirmation and any necessary actions or instructions to finalize your return once our team has processed your\u00a0request.

Please note, if you purchased your permit via payroll deduction after your enrollment has begun, we are only able to cancel future deductions, and we cannot modify current deduction amounts. We can also only have parking payroll deduction enrollment entered once per fiscal year, per\u00a0employee. Upgrades: Please note that requests to upgrade will require an additional out-of-pocket payment of the difference in current price between your current and upgraded permit. If you purchased your permit via payroll deduction, your deductions will remain the same, and your upgrade value must be paid via credit/debit card. Upgrade amounts cannot be paid via payroll deduction, and your deduction amount cannot be\u00a0modified. Exchanges: For exchanges of the same value, no payment will be required, and no refund will be issued.  If you purchased your permit via payroll deduction, your deductions will remain the\u00a0same. Downgrades: You may be eligible for a prorated refund of the difference in current price between your current and downgraded permit when downgrading your parking permit. Please note if you purchased your permit via payroll deduction, we are only able to cancel future deductions, and we cannot modify current deduction amounts. We will calculate the value you have used, minus the amount you have paid. We then apply any applicable credit towards the current permit price, and the remaining permit balance must be paid out of pocket. At this point, your permit would then be paid in full with no future payroll deductions\u00a0occurring. Cancellations: Annual permits are eligible for refund if purchased in full. Refund amount will be determined by the date of return through the end of the fiscal year. Permits purchased via payroll deduction are \u201cpay as you go\u201d and are deducted on the month following your parking usage. Permits purchased via payroll deduction and are not eligible for refund, but may be canceled to prevent future\u00a0deductions. If you purchased your permit via credit/debit card, you may be eligible for a refund of your current permit value if you request to cancel your parking permit either within 10 days of your initial purchase, or if you are canceling your permit prior to the tenth day of the current month. If you no longer need your permit, you may return your permit within 10 days from the date of purchase for a full refund. You may also request to cancel (deactivate) your parking permit on or before the tenth day of the current month for a prorated refund of the current permit value. Any cancellation requests submitted after the tenth day of the month will only receive credit for the following month\u2019s permit\u00a0value. If you purchased via payroll deduction, you may request to cancel (deactivate) your permit and future payroll deductions. Your cancellation must be submitted on or before the tenth day of the current month to avoid being charged for that month of parking. Any cancellation requests submitted after the tenth day of the month will have one additional deduction on the next paycheck cycle. Thereafter, future deductions will be\u00a0canceled.

This system\n utilizes License Plate Recognition\n (LPR [License Plate Recognition] )\n and will identify your vehicle by its license plate. This system removes the need\n for physical stickers and allows all permit holders to easily add and maintain vehicles\n on their\u00a0accounts. License Plate Recognition\n (LPR [License Plate Recognition] )\n is camera-based technology that quickly scans multiple vehicle license plates. This\n technology allows us to transition to virtual permits by allowing a vehicle\u2019s\n license plate to serve in place of a sticker or decal permit. LPR cameras can scan your\n license plate to check if you have appropriate parking permissions, which eliminates\n the need to place a physical permit on your windshield. LPR is a mobile system that uses\n vehicle-mounted cameras to scan license plates and verify virtual permits in all lots\n and garages on\u00a0campus. Virtual Permits will be beneficial to our campus as they eliminate the need to move\n your permit between multiple vehicles. They also support sustainability by reducing\n paper usage, ink, and plastic used for permit distribution and\u00a0postage. You can register your vehicles to your Virtual Permit through the online Parking Portal.\n To register a vehicle online, log in to your MyParking account and select the vehicles tab. You will then\n be able to add a vehicle by entering the license plate and other vehicle details.\n Students may register two (2) vehicles to their virtual permit and employees\n may register five (5) vehicles to their virtual permit; however, only one\n vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. Parking more than one vehicle on\n campus at one time may lead to citations. The current fine amount for parking multiple vehicles on campus is $100, per\u00a0vehicle. UT\u00a0Dallas Parking & Transportation requests vehicle license\n plates to be registered to a specific customer and vehicle. \u201cDealer Plates\u201d\n are not vehicle specific and do not provide ownership information and therefore cannot\n be affiliated to customer\u2019s\u00a0accounts. You may add vehicles to your permit at anytime online via the MyParking portal, but you must contact our office at park@utdallas.edu to remove vehicles.\n Please note vehicles can be requested to be updated up to three times per semester.\n Exchanging vehicles on your permit more frequently may be\u00a0denied. All virtual permits are non-transferable and can only be used by the individual\n to whom it is assigned. Permit sharing is prohibited and may lead to parking citations\n and/or vehicle\u00a0immobilization. It is essential that all vehicle information is kept up-to-date to avoid receiving\n an unnecessary citation. Please log into your parking account to update your information\n immediately after any change to your license plate or vehicle. In the event that you\n drive a different vehicle to campus, you will also need to ensure that it is currently\n registered to your permit before parking on\u00a0campus. UT\u00a0Dallas Parking & Transportation Services utilizes vehicle state registration from the Texas Department of Transportation to determine relationships between vehicles and drivers. Vehicles not registered with UT\u00a0Dallas Parking & Transportation may be linked to a customer\u2019s account based on state registration\u00a0records. If you no longer own a vehicle, it is imperative that you properly transfer the\n vehicle to the new owner. Failing to properly transfer a vehicle into the buyer\u2019s\n name could result in the seller being held responsible for tickets, toll violations,\n or even crimes committed with the vehicle. To ensure this doesn\u2019t happen to\n you, accompany the buyer to your county tax office to ensure a vehicle title\n application is\u00a0filed. A dealer is not required to title in the dealership\u2019s name if you sell or\n trade-in your vehicle to a licensed motor vehicle dealer. The vehicle stays in your\n name until it is sold to an individual, which may take months or in some cases, years.\n To protect yourself, file a Vehicle Transfer Notification. When a vehicle\n transfer notification is received, \nTxDMV [Texas Department of Motor Vehicles] \n updates the motor vehicle record to show the vehicle as sold. When you file the\n notification within 30 days from the date of sale, you cannot be held responsible\n for parking tickets that have been committed by the person who purchased\n the\u00a0vehicle. \u00a0 The International Symbol of Access To use one of the Accessible parking spaces on campus,\n you must already own a State of Texas Accessible license plate/placard, and\n you must purchase a UT Dallas Accessible permit. When purchasing your\u00a0permit: Once your Accessible parking credentials are validated, you will be able to see the\n Accessible parking permit option available for purchase online. Accessible Parking Spaces (PDF [Portable Document Format File] ) If Accessible spaces are not available, those with a state-issued license plate\n that features the International Symbol of Access\n (ISA [International Symbol of Access] ), \n or a state-issued Accessible placard, and displaying a UTD permit\n (either an Accessible parking permit or visitor pass),\n may park in any available non-reserved parking space or metered parking space\n at no additional\u00a0cost. \u00a0 Per \nSB\u00a0792 (PDF [Portable Document Format File] ),\n as of January 1, 2022, anyone parking in an Accessible parking space must\n have an Accessible license plate or an Accessible parking placard that features the\n International Symbol of Access\n (ISA [International Symbol of Access] ).\n Currently, disabled veteran license\n plates do not feature the ISA. Texans with disabled veteran license plates wishing to use\n Accessible parking spaces in 2022 may apply for an Accessible parking placard or for\n a new disabled veteran license plate featuring the ISA. The veteran must meet the\n eligibility requirements for an Accessible parking placard or Accessible person license\n plate featuring the ISA. Not all disabilities that qualify a veteran for disabled veteran\n license plates will qualify a veteran for a disabled veteran license plate featuring\n the ISA. More information can be found at the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles\u00a0website.

Currently enrolled students, or\n currently employed faculty or staff, do not qualify for visitor\u00a0permits. From UTDBP3119: The University of Texas at\u00a0Dallas does not allow University departments to pay for parking permits for individual University employees using University funds. Departments may purchase a parking permit that is owned by the department and used by multiple individuals as needed. The purpose of a departmental permit is not to replace the need for employees to purchase their own parking permit, but to facilitate ease of parking when employees are performing their job duties on campus. It is the responsibility of the department head or their designee to ensure departmental passes are used appropriately. Departmental permits must be purchased via IDT [Inter-Departmental Transfer]  or journal transfer \u2014 not on a University One Card. Any University funds may be used to purchase departmental parking\u00a0passes. Departments may also purchase permits for guests, suppliers, or contractors, when appropriate. These permits must be purchased via IDT [Inter-Departmental Transfer]  or journal transfers \u2014 not on a University One Card. Also, the cost must be included on an independent contractor\u2019s 1099-NEC tax form as a taxable\u00a0benefit. Current UT\u00a0Dallas students, faculty, or staff that require access to a restricted\n parking area may be eligible for a short-term permit. To be eligible for this permit,\n the student, faculty, or staff member must already own a current UT\u00a0Dallas parking permit,\n and the request must be for legitimate business or academic\u00a0purposes. Visitor parking can be issued to those visiting UTD for legitimate business or academic\n purposes if requested by the sponsoring department. Departments may use our online permit request tool or visit one of our\n offices during our normal business hours to obtain a permit for a University approved\n guest. Please reach out to the department you are visiting to have them arrange parking\n for\u00a0you. If you are a faculty or staff member and you need to arrange parking for a guest visiting\n the campus, permits can also be requested online in advance and emailed to you as a \nPDF [Portable Document Format File] \n document that you may email to your guest to be printed.

This further provides that \u201cThe board may prescribe courses leading to customary degrees offered at leading American universities and may award those degrees. It is the intent of the legislature that those degrees include bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and doctor\u2019s degrees, and their equivalents.\u201d However, no \u201cdepartment, school, or degree program\u201d can be instituted without the \u201cprior approval\u201d of the Coordinating Board, Texas College and University System. The legislature also provided that \u201cThe board may adopt other rules and regulations for the operation, control, and management of the university that are necessary for the conduct of the university as one of the first class.\u201d These additional rules and regulations are published as the Regents\u2019 Rules. According to\u00a0Regents\u2019 Rule 20201, the president is the chief executive officer, reporting to and responsible to the chancellor of the UT System.

The vice president for academic affairs and provost is the chief academic officer for the University, responsible for the formulation and implementation of educational policy. The provost oversees faculty hiring, evaluation, and advancement; budget priorities and budget allocations for the schools; and academic facilities. The provost serves as the University\u2019s primary contact with the UT System Office of Academic Affairs. The vice president for facilities and economic development oversees facilities, buildings, parking, transportation and real estate management. The vice president for budget and finance is responsible for all financial functions, including budget, finance, payroll, procurement and expense reimbursement. The vice president for information technology provides the physical, personnel, and financial resources for information technologies that support students, faculty, and staff in accomplishing the research, instructional, and public service functions of the University.

Degrees are awarded by programs. In addition to the usual disciplinary approaches, the University has a strong commitment to interdisciplinary study at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. Most faculty members teach in both graduate and undergraduate areas so that all instruction is informed by critical examination of the most recent developments in all fields.

    "https://www.utdallas.edu/fact-sheets/epps/bs-geospatial-information-sciences/": "Geospatial information sciences (GIS) harness groundbreaking technologies for Spatial Big Data Analytics that make location and interaction key to our understanding of social and environmental dynamics. GIS graduates will master the knowledge and skills to spatially integrate data and computing resources for informed decision-making in environmental modeling, business intelligence, precision agriculture, smart cities, public safety and community resilience, just to name a few. Recent technological innovations have greatly enhanced our ability to collect and analyze massive environmental, social and economic data about places as well as individuals. Now more than ever before, unmanned aviation vehicles (UAV) equipped with remote sensors provide near-real time imagery whenever they are needed. LiDAR point clouds enable us to build high-resolution 3D models of buildings, trees and terrains. Location-based services and mobile geospatial apps allow us to search information based on proximity to our locations and connect our social networks in both physical and cyberspaces. From Microsoft and Apple to Google, and from the United Nations to indigenous communities, geospatial information science and technologies play an essential role for social-environmental inventory, planning, and forecasting of food, water, energy and health. These technologies include geographic information systems (GIS), the Global Positioning System (GPS) and satellite-based remote sensing.
